<p><b>About the Game:</b></p>
<pre>Zombie Warfare was a game I along with two classmates, Tiffany and Eddie, had created.
The game revolves around a Mother named Scarlett who is stranded on an island without ammunition
and is on a mission to save her son Alonzo. The duty is yours to complete three levels in order
to save Alonzo and escape the island infested with zombies.
(Check out the game on Scratch! Feel free to leave me any feedback about the game through Scratch. Enjoy!)</pre>
<p><b>Reflection:</b></p>
<pre>The beginning of this process of creating Zombie Warfare was September 5th, 2017 where the
class scattered to find new partners after we were told by our teacher that we had a choice of
making a story or game. I knew from the start that our group of three would cooperate well as
we quickly agreed that a game would be best because it would teach us the most while being the
most fun as well. We decided that we should do a game based on survival since we all liked and
played those games at home. About 2 weeks had gone by along with some alpha testing with other 
students but at tis point our game was basically complete. We ran it through its courses and it 
seemed to be working quite well. We did notice some flaws but overall the game was functional 
and everyone who tested it out seemed to enjoy it. The game itself consisted of two algorithms 
and the second being an abstraction. When the game starts, the menu is displayed, giving an
option to play or get help with contol instructions. Once the play button is clicked then it 
will take you to a map where three levels are shown. Our original goal was to have the game only 
play in chronological order however that was one of the features we were unable to include before
the last day, being one of the components in the game we hoped to fix if there were more time.
Once you complete each of the levels a "Level __ Complete" and "Click to Continue" would appear,
however, if you were to die a "Gameover" and "Restart" would appear. In the 3rd and last level you
are to go towards the middle of the page where the sprite, Alonzo, is located and then the X to 
go to to end the game would appear. This level is slightly different as it has a "boss" that moves
quicker and basically a second objective rather than the other levels with only one purpose 
which is to just head towards the X. Our first algorithm was similar in all three levels for the 
most part besidess having the zombies movement change a bit. The second algorithm, however, is
exactly the same for all three levels as it is a "define" for the main sprite's control. This
also counts for our abstraction as it simplifies the first algorithm, making the main sprite's 
script less confusing to look at. We encountered the mistake of having our broadcasts interfer
with each other. This was a pain as it caused our notifications for "Gameover" or the level 
completion not to pop up. I ended up having to remix the program to find the issue without messing
up the original. I had to stay up late and redo every single script in order for our game to work 
for the day of alpha testing. Though at that moment I was upset I had to redo the coding, the 
workload was distributed evenly as my partners did a great job at their part in the game. This 
process of working cooperatively with my two partners allowed us to communicate when we were 
frustruated, help out when one of us did not understand, and even grow closer as friends and 
classmates not that we had spent about two weeks working on the game. The opportunity to work 
with them was beneficial for me and it has definitely taught me to be patient and overall a 
better programmer.</pre>
