<p>Zombie Warfare Game</p>

<p><b>About the Game:</b></p>
<pre>Zombie Warfare was a game I along with two classmates, Tiffany and Eddie, had created.
The game revolves around a Mother named Scarlett who is stranded on an island without ammunition
and is on a mission to save her son Alonzo. The duty is yours to complete three levels in order
to save Alonzo and escape the island infested with zombies.
(Check out the game on Scratch! Feel free to leave me any feedback about the game through Scratch. Enjoy!)</pre>
<p><b>Reflection:</b></p>
<pre>The beginning of this process of creating Zombie Warfare was September 5th, 2017 where the
class scattered to find new partners after we were told by our teacher that we had a choice of
making a story or game. I knew from the start that our group of three would cooperate well as
we quickly agreed that a game would be best because it would teach us the most while being the
most fun as well. We decided that we should do a game based on survival since we all liked and
played those games at home. About 2 weeks had gone by along with some alpha testing with other 
students but at tis point our game was basically complete. We ran it through its courses and it 
seemed to be working quite well. We did notice some flaws but overall the game was functional 
and everyone who tested it out seemed to enjoy it. The game itself consisted of two algorithms 
and the second being an abstraction. When the game starts, the menu is displayed, giving an
option to play or get help with contol instructions. Once the play button is clicked then it 
will take you to a map where three levels are shown. Our original goal was to have the game only 
play in chronological order however that was one of the features we were unable to include before
the last day, being one of the components in the game we hoped to fix if there were more time.
Once you complete each of the levels a "Level __ Complete" and "Click to Continue" would appear,
however, if you were to die a "Gameover" and "Restart" would appear. In the 3rd and last level you
are to go towards the middle of the page where the sprite, Alonzo, is located and then the X to 
go to to end the game would appear. This level is slightly different as it has a "boss" that moves
quicker and basically a second objective rather than the other levels with only one purpose 
which is to just head towards the X. Our first algorithm was similar in all three levels for the 
most part besidess having the zombies movement change a bit. The second algorithm, however, is
exactly the same for all three levels as it is a "define" for the main sprite's control. This
also counts for our abstraction as it simplifies the first algorithm, making the main sprite's 
script less confusing to look at. We encountered the mistake of having our broadcasts interfer
with each other. This was a pain as it caused our notifications for "Gameover" or the level 
completion not to pop up. I ended up having to remix the program to find the issue without messing
up the original. I had to stay up late and redo every single script in order for our game to work 
for the day of alpha testing. Though at that moment I was upset I had to redo the coding, the 
workload was distributed evenly as my partners did a great job at their part in the game. This 
process of working cooperatively with my two partners allowed us to communicate when we were 
frustruated, help out when one of us did not understand, and even grow closer as friends and 
classmates not that we had spent about two weeks working on the game. The opportunity to work 
with them was beneficial for me and it has definitely taught me to be patient and overall a 
better programmer.</pre>

<p><b>About the App:</b></p>
<pre>My partner and I had the idea of having an app on your phone that could help people manage
their budget and inventory. We both thought that by creating an app that can do such tasks would
help many be relieved of stress and have some more down time.</pre>

<p><b>Reflection:</b></p>
<pre>Throughout the process of creating this app with my partner we had encountered different
obstacles. We struggled on App Inventor because it was more difficult compared to Scratch. 
However, because we were able to eventually get the main function of the app to work, the
rest of the coding came to us much easier. We utilized a list to contain all of the products
and items that the user inputed and some algorithms that would react when the user would
click on a certain function like deleting the most recent item in the list. My partner and
I spent much time outside of school working on our own parts since we found it difficult to 
utilize the tiny database. If we had had more time to work on the project we would have liked
to refine the app more because there were some issues with deleting a specific item from the
list and having the list save and reopen after the app was closed. App Inventor introduced
to new functions we were not familiar with and brought more teamwork and cooperation amongst
my partner and I and for the whole class.</pre>

<p><b>Python Interactive Story</b></p>
</a>
<p><b>About the Story:</b></p>
<pre>The class was the make an interactive story with a partner that would obviously be
interactive the choices one would make. Since my partner and I are both into cars and not
too excited about social gatherings we thought it would be clever to make a story about the
dangers of driving if one were to be under the influence. This was to bring some awareness 
to students in our class or whoever that was playing our interactive story.</pre>

<p><b>Reflection:</b></p>
<pre>This project compared to the two previous being the Scratch game and App was much easier.
A flowchart was created before hand so that it could reduce the amount of time coding since
the story is the main piece of the coding. The only negative to this interactive story is that
occasionally my partner and I would forget where the next step or part of the story would lead 
to since there are many possibilities or choices that the user can pick from. Coding the story
was no very stressful at all, in fact, we found it to be the most entertaining program we have
made so far. The interactive story took a lot of cooperation since the responses to each choice
had to be something that would lead the story to continue. My partner and I felt like we did
not need more time because we had more than enough to even go back and double check that all
spelling errors were corrected. Overall, the interactive story's coding was a great process.</pre>

<p><b>Battleship (Python Game)</b></p>
</a>
<p><b>About the Game:</b></p> 
<pre>My partner and I both enjoy playing games so while we were choosing from the list, the
idea of recreating the iconic Battleship game was the one that made most sense. We knew that
most of our other classmates had games that could potentially be fun like how we envisioned
ours to be, however, what we really wanted over the other games was to be aesthetically pleasing
even if it was on repl.it. We wanted to recreate the game to be much simpler that was user
friendly, could notify users of any errors (like invalid coordinates), and pleasing to look at.
Our game was liked by many of our fellow classmates because it did what it was suppose to do and
more while not being too complicated in its design.</pre>

<p><b>Reflection:</b></p>
<pre>The program turned out to be a lot better of a game than I had originally thought. My partner
and I thought it was going to be difficult to get it to looking aesthetically pleasing while being
a simple enough game that most users would not even need any extensive directions. We received much
positive feedback during alpha and beta testing and also in its final version. We managed time well
in the fact that we were able to refine our coding for the game to work as smoothly as possible
even if the user were to type in coordinates that are way outside the 5x5 grid. We found it was best
to give users only 5 tries because any more than that would just be too easy. Things went well for 
us during the process because some of the requirements like having algorithms and a test function
were already implemented because it helped us, not because it was needed for a higher grade during
the submission of our project. My partner and I did not experience problems with time management
because we were able to work on it at home since we are brothers. Our battleship game could have
have use maybe one improvement in its coding which was a function to deal with letter inputs in
case the user accidentally typed it instead of a number. Other than that we only really wanted for
the box to be marked with an X if the player guessed the right coordinate. We found the Python Game
to be a little challenging but it was manageable with its difficulty because it had become a personal
favorite out of the other projects we had done in class.</pre>

<p><b>Image Artist (Python Activity 1.4.7)</b></p>
<p><b>About the Image Filter:</b></p>
<pre>My partner and I wanted to create a filter that was not as simple as cropping the corners to
become round and leave it as is so instead we opted for a filter that would make it look like old
televison. The filter makes an image black and white while having the static speckles.</pre>
<p><b>Original Image:</b></p>
<img src="images/JerryMouse.png" height="300">
<p><b>Image After Filtered:</b></p>
<img src="images/" height="300>"
<p><b>Coding / Input:</b></p>
<img src="images/Code.PNG" height="400">
<pre>After importing the image we had two define functions. We simplified much of our original program
so that it was easier to read and look at while functioning just as well and how we wanted it to. The
first define is the overlay of our static image. What this function does is that it layers an image
of televison static over our original image of Jerry while having its opacity lowered. This will allow
the original image to be shown still. The function sets the black and white version of the image as the
background and the static image as the overlay. Keeping in mind that the image must be the same
dimensions, which is shown through lines 13-19 of the coding, the background will be pasted with its
slightly translucent overlay.</pre>
<img src="images/Input.PNG" height="150">
<pre>The black and white function is to top it off by having the colored image now be black and white.
It looked too awkward to have a static filter over an image if it was still colored so by making it
black and white we accomplished the look through an old television. The function converts the original
colored image to being black and white from lines 25-29 with its most important component being
color_image.convert.</pre>
<p><b>Reflection:</b></p>
<pre>My partner and I struggled for the first two days of working on the coding for this filter. We
found sources online that helped us a little but for the most part it was near useless. We do give
credit, however, to Stack Overflow because it was where we were able to find out how layer the same
dimensioned picture over another. It was not until the last day we had to work on the project that we
actually had the code functioning properly. Our main issue with this process was that we were not too
familiar with overlaying and changing opacity. The project was not as long as some of our other ones
but it was great practice for us since it made us improve in Python.</pre>
